# Enhancing monocular depth estimation with frequency features

In this repository we provide the code to use our proposed frequency encoder and Spatial-Frequency feature fusion. 
We provide code for the single-scale case and the multi-scale case.

## Frequency Features
Code to replicate our proposal and the implementation with ResNet and Depth Anything networks will be released soon.
